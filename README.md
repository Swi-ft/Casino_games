Casino Game Simulator & Analytics (R)

This repository provides a suite of R functions for simulating and analyzing popular casino games, including Roulette, Craps, and Sic Bo. The simulations use Monte Carlo methods to calculate key metrics like expected value (EV) and win rate with results validated against analytical calculations.
Features

    Monte Carlo simulation functions for Roulette, Craps, and Sic Bo

    Accurate estimation of expected values, win rates, and other performance statistics

    Validation against known analytical results for reliability

    Modular design to easily extend or customize simulations

    Efficient and reproducible probabilistic modeling

Supported Games

    Roulette: Simulate spins and calculate returns based on different bet types

    Craps: Simulate rolls with all major betting options to compute probabilities and payouts

    Sic Bo: Simulate dice throws with various bet types and outcomes

Methodology

    Utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to generate a large number of random game outcomes

    Aggregates results to estimate expected values and win probabilities

    Cross-checked against analytical probabilities to ensure accuracy
